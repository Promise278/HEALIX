## 🩹 Doctor Verification Workflow

1. Doctor registers with:
   - Full name  
   - License number  
   - Medical council (MDCN)  
   - Certificate upload  

2. Admin reviews and verifies details via [MDCN Portal](https://portal.mdcn.gov.ng/).  
3. Once approved, the doctor’s account status changes to **“verified.”**  
4. Verified doctors can then access Healix’s consultation and management tools.

## 💡 Inspiration

In a world where access to healthcare can be limited by distance or time, **Healix** bridges the gap — linking patients and doctors through technology, compassion, and trust.

> Because healing should never be out of reach.
